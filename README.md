    * Optionally install and configure Dnsmasq DNS server for resolving application domains (useful in Vagrant VMs)
    * Install OpenShift prerequisites

    * Install OpenShift master and node with Ansible playbook provided by OpenShift
    * Download OpenShift component docker images
    * Install required router
    * Install required internal Docker registry
    * Configure test users when running in Vagrant, matching the ones in used in https://github.com/openshift/training

  * Upgrade OpenShift Origin, currently 1.0.3 to 1.0.4

## Todo

   * Improve this README.
   * Implement upgrade of ImageStream images.

## Vagrant
If you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed you can get a
virtual machine with a fully operational OpenShift Origin M5 master and node by running:

    vagrant up origin-master

Installing OpenShift inside the VM will take several minutes, depending on the speed of your machine and your
internet connection.
If you then point the resolver of your host machine to the IP address of the newly created virtual machine 
(172.22.22.22) you will be able to resolve the OpenShift Master and any deployed application by name,
provided the applications use one of the preconfigured domains (*.cloudapps.example.com, *.openshiftapps.com).
Please refer to this documentation for instructions on how to change the resolver on various operation systems,
but remember to use the IP address of the created virtual machine (172.22.22.22):
https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.
The OpenShift Web Console is now available under https://origin-master.example.com:8443/.
