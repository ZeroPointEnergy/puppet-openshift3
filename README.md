## Description

Puppet Module to install and manage OpenShift Enterprise 3 and OpenShift Origin M5 on RHEL/CentOS 7.1 or later. This module has been tested with
Puppet 3.8.x.

Work in progress!

    * Optionally install and configure Dnsmasq DNS server for resolving application domains (useful in Vagrant VMs)
    * Install OpenShift prerequisites
    * Install and configure Ansible
    * Install OpenShift master and node with Ansible playbook provided by OpenShift
    * Download OpenShift component docker images
    * Install required router
    * Install required internal Docker registry
    * Configure test users when running in Vagrant, matching the ones in used in https://github.com/openshift/training
  * Upgrade OpenShift Enterprise

## Setup

### What [modulename] affects **OPTIONAL**

If it's obvious what your module touches, you can skip this section. For example, folks can probably figure out that your mysql_instance module affects their MySQL instances.

If there's more that they should know about, though, this is the place to mention:

* Files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact, or execute.
* Dependencies that your module automatically installs.
* Warnings or other important notices.

### Setup Requirements

#### OpenShift Enterprise
To install OpenShift Enterprise your system needs to be correctly registered and have a suitable OpenShift Enterprise subscription attached.
This module automatically enables the required package repositories. Please note that OpenShift Enterprise 3 can only be installed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1
or later. Newer versions of OpenShift Enterprise 3.x may require newer versions of RHEL. Please check the "Prerequisites"
section of the "Installation and Configuration" guide of the version you want to install.

#### OpenShift Origin
Installation of OpenShift Origin has been tested on CentOS 7.1 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1. To install OpenShift Origin on RHEL your system
needs to be correctly registered and have a suitable RHEL subscription attached. This module automatically enables the required package repositories.

### Beginning with openshift3

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most basic use of the module.

    class { 'openshift3':
      deployment_type => 'enterprise',               # or 'origin', which is also the default
      master          => 'ose3-master.example.com',  # FQDN of your OpenShift 3 master
      version         => '3.1.0.4',                  # OpenShift version to install
    }

## Usage

This section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do the fancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you include usage examples and code samples for doing things with your module.

## Reference

Here, include a complete list of your module's classes, types, providers, facts, along with the parameters for each. Users refer to this section (thus the name "Reference") to find specific details; most users don't read it per se.

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there are Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should consider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel are necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header. 


## Vagrant
If you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed you can get a
virtual machine with a fully operational OpenShift Origin M5 master and node by running:

    vagrant up origin-master

Installing OpenShift inside the VM will take several minutes, depending on the speed of your machine and your
internet connection.
If you then point the resolver of your host machine to the IP address of the newly created virtual machine 
(172.22.22.22) you will be able to resolve the OpenShift Master and any deployed application by name,
provided the applications use one of the preconfigured domains (*.cloudapps.example.com, *.openshiftapps.com).
Please refer to this documentation for instructions on how to change the resolver on various operation systems,
but remember to use the IP address of the created virtual machine (172.22.22.22):
https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.
The OpenShift Web Console is now available under https://origin-master.example.com:8443/.
